How to compile and run The GUI Highlighter Tool:

1. Clone the repository, either using the git clone command with the repository link from the command line or utilizing an IDE that has cloning capabilities like VSCode.
2. run pip install -r requirements.txt from the root directory of the repository to install all necessary packages to run the tool
3. Once packages are installed, use the python GUILeafHighlighter command to run the tool that will take the screenshots from the Programming-Assignment-Data\Programming-Assignment-Data directory, highlight them, and save them into the GeneratedPNGS directory.
4. If you would like to add screenshots to be highlighted, be sure to include them in the Programming-Assignment-Data\Programming-Assignment-Data directory with their corresponding xml file, ensuring that the file names are EXACTLY THE SAME other than the extension to ensure the tool can recognize them.
5. Once the tool notifies you from the command line that it has completed, you can access the GeneratedPNGS folder.
